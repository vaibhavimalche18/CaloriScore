🧠 Food Calorie Estimator

A deep learning–based project that estimates the calorie content of food from images and nutritional data.
Built using CNN (for image-based prediction) and Random Forest Regression (for nutrient-based prediction), the system provides both individual and hybrid calorie predictions.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Flask, React, MySQL
Dataset: Food-101 (images) + Nutrition Facts Dataset (calorie mapping)

Features:

Image preprocessing, enhancement, and feature extraction

Nutritional data regression model

Hybrid AI model for more accurate calorie estimation

REST API backend + React frontend for prediction interface
